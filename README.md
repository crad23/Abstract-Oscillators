**Simulating Classical Coupled Harmonic Oscillators Using [Classiq](https://www.classiq.io/)**

In recent years, Quantum Computing has made remarkable strides, with increasingly powerful quantum computers being developed annually. Today, machines with hundreds of qubits 
can execute quantum algorithms with circuit depths reaching into the thousands, all while preserving a significant signal. However, a key challenge within the quantum computing 
ecosystem is the development of efficient and innovative quantum algorithms that are not only practical but also offer exponential advantages over classical methods.

One of the most promising areas of research in quantum algorithms is Hamiltonian simulation, particularly in simulating classical coupled harmonic oscillators. Our project aims to
bridge the gap between theory and practice by translating the theoretical framework presented in the **2023** study by R. Babbush, D. W. Berry, R. Kothari, R. D. Somma, and N. Wiebe,
*Exponential Quantum Speedup in Simulating Coupled Classical Oscillators*, published in Phys. Rev. X 13, 041041 (2023), into a practical implementation compatible with current quantum 
hardware and software capabilities.

The objective of our [Womanium Quantum+AI 2024](https://womanium.org/Quantum/AI) Final Project is to implement, optimize, and evaluate the simulation of classical coupled harmonic 
oscillators as detailed in the study. You canaccess the original paper [here](https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/references/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.6.013224).
